# Code

This repository will hold all the code I have ever written (mostly) in  the Arduino language and Python that had not been deleted. It will keep it safe in the case that I need it, whether I am working on another computer or it is lost on the original one. Edit what you want to in the appropriate branch, and pull request it and I will add it to the main repo. Have fun!

## My Boards

Currently, I have:

1. Arduino Uno
2. Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266
3. Raspberry Pi 3 B+
4. Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
5. Arduino MKR WiFi 1010
