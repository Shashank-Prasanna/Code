# Code

This repository will hold all the code I have ever written (mostly) in  the Arduino language, Python, and Javascript that has not been deleted. It will keep it safe in the case that I need it, whether I am working on another computer or it is lost on the original one. Edit what you want to in the appropriate branch, and pull request it and I will add it to the main repo. Have fun!
